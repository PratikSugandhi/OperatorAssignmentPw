Usage of ternary operator and it's syntax

JavaScript Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator) is a concise way to write a conditional (if-else) statement.
Ternary Operator takes three operands i.e. condition, true value and false value.

syntax is-
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
**
The expression consists of three operands: the condition, value if true, and value if false.
The evaluation of the condition should result in either a true/false or a boolean value.
The true value lies between “?” & “:” and is executed if the condition returns true. Similarly, the false value lies after “:” and is executed if the condition returns false
